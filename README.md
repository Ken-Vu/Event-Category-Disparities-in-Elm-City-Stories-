In 2022, the American Statistican Association hosted DataFest at California State University - East Bay.  DataFest is a three-day competition in which teams of students are given a data set in which they work to come up with a research project using the data.  They come up with their own research questions, perform analysis work to explore them, and then present their results to a panel of judges for evaluation.  Three teams are then selected and evaluated for receiving one of three awards - Best In Show, Best Use of Statistical Analysis, and Best Visualization (with one of these awards to be given to one undergraduate team).  

## Research Question
For DataFest 2022, we were given a data set for the game "Elm City Stories" where we decided to focus on one particular question - What are the **top three** types of events that took up the most playing time for players from each school?
